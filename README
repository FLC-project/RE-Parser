This program contains the implementation the parallel RE parser and recognizer.

Installation

    There is no need to install it, the program can be run directly from a command prompt.
    The data of the Fasta, Traffic and Bible benchmarks must be downloaded from the
    sites reported in the papers.

Run

    java -cp repar.jar pbsp.ReParTest  <arguments>

The <arguments> are described in ReParTest.jpp.
Omitting the arguments runs the measurements of the parallel parser that are
described in the papers.

Generation

    The program has been developed with Oracle jdk 19.

The sources are provided here to show an implementation of the algorithms described
in the papers. The generation of the ReParTest program needs tools and libraries that
are not provided here.

Motivating example

The example described in the introduction of the paper has been done as follows:

$ grep "To:" examplemail.txt | awk -f re.awk

 Paul Brown
 Lily Roberts
 Elon Musk
 bla bla To: my friends
 bla bla
